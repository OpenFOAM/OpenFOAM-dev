Overview
========
+ Template case for rotating geometry flow for a closed geometry
+ Can be used for MRF or NCC simulations.
+ Setup to run the incompressibleFluid solver module for MRF or NCC
+ The case is designed to be meshed with snappyHexMesh
+ snappyHexMesh is setup to use 3 trisurface files
  + fixed.obj: CAD of the stationary (external) geometry
  + rotating.obj: CAD of the rotating geometry
  + rotatingZone.obj: CAD of surface bounding the rotating region
+ Copy the *.obj files to the constant/geometry directory
+ The fixed.obj should contain an inlet and outlet region to create the relevant
  patches in the mesh

Background Mesh
===============
+ The blockMeshDict file contains a configuration for a cylindrical background
  mesh aligned along the z-axis
+ The mesh includes a core box-shaped block and inner and outer cylinders
+ The backgroundMesh subdictionary includes key geometric parameters of the mesh
+ The inner cylinder relates to the rotatingZone.obj
+ The outer cyliner relates to the external boundary, e.g. fixed.obj
+ Set the radii of inner and outer cylinders to ~2% larger than respective OBJ
  files
+ Set background mesh density with boxCells, inCells, outCells and zCells
+ Run blockMesh
+ NOTE: An alternative blockMeshDict-box file exists if the user wants a regular
  box-shaped background mesh, similar to set up in the inflowOutflow template

Features
========
+ Run surfaceFeatures to extract features for explicit feature capturing

Castellated Mesh
================
+ run snappyHexMesh to obtain a castellatedMesh
+ Review the mesh; modify refinement levels and regenerate the mesh as required
  (levels are set in refinementSurfaces and refinementRegions)

Snapped Mesh
============
+ In snappyHexMeshDict, set castellatedMesh off; snap on;
+ Run the snapping phase of snappyHexMesh
+ Review the mesh

Layers
======
+ To add layers to the mesh along wall boundary patches...
+ Switch on addLayers; switch snap off;
+ Run snappyHexMesh
+ The number of layers can be changed by modifying nSurfaceLayers

Initialisation
==============
+ Initialise the field files in the 0 directory
+ Set the viscosity in constant/transportProperties
+ Rotating properties are set in constant/rotatingZoneProperties
  + For MRF, this file is included from constant/MRFProperties
  + For NCC, this file is included from constant/dynamicMeshDict
+ Ensure settings are appropriate in controlDict, fvSchemes, fvSolution, for
  relevant simulation; for NCC, in particular, ensure that deltaT, ddtSchemes
  and relaxationFactors are set for transient simulation

NCC Simulation
==============
+ After the mesh is generated, the couple must be created at the boundary
  of the rotatingZone
+ createBaffles must first be run to generate two non-coupled patches from
  the faces in the faceZone bounding the rotatingZone, e.g. by
    createBaffles -overwrite
+ splitBaffles must then be run to duplicate the vertices shared by the
  non-coupled patches to enable them to move independently, e.g. by
    splitBaffles -overwrite
+ createNonConformalCouples must then be run to generate the couple patches
  required by NCC, e.g. by
    createNonConformalCouples -overwrite
+ disable MRF by deleting the constant/MRFProperties file
+ enable NCC by changing 'mover-disabled' to 'mover' in constant/dynamicMeshDict
