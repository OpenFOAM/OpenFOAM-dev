Overview
=======
+ This is a template case for a closed volume
+ Setup to run buoyantFoam
+ The case is designed to be meshed with snappyHexMesh
+ snappyHexMesh is setup to use a single trisurface file named CAD.obj
+ Copy the CAD.obj file to the constant/geometry directory
+ The CAD.obj can contain one or more regions to create patches in the mesh
+ The user can then specify different boundary condition on T on these patches

Meshing
=======
+ Meshing is setup as in the inflowOutflow template
+ See $FOAM_ETC/templates/inflowOutflow/README for details
+ The setup includes an example for one named patch to be generated in the mesh
+ In snappyHexMeshDict, replace <CADregionName> with the name of region in the
  trisurface; replace <patchName> with the name of the resulting mesh patch

Initialisation
==============
+ In the field files in the 0 directory, set initial values
+ The template includes a fixedValue boundary condition on <patchName> in 0/T
+ The user can replace <patchName> with a real mesh patch name and apply a
  fixed temperature on that patch
