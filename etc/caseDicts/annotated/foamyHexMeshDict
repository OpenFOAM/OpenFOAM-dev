Control dictionary for foamyHexMesh - automatic mesh generator.

foamyHexMesh phases:
1. fill volume with initial points (initialPoints subdictionary). An option
   is to reread from previous set of points.

2. internal point motion (motionControl subdictionary)

3. every once in a while add point duplets/triplets to conform to
   surfaces and features (surfaceConformation subdictionary)

4. back to 2

5. construct polyMesh.
    - filter (polyMeshFiltering subdictionary)
    - check (meshQualityControls subdictionary) and undo filtering
