// This is a sample configuration for creating baffles. Notes:
//
// - This utility usually converts internal faces into two boundary faces.
//
// - It can also convert boundary faces into a boundary face on a different
//   patch.
//
// - Faces are selected to make into baffles by specifying either a faceZone or
//   a searchableSurface.
//
// - Each selection requires two patches to be specified; the owner (or master)
//   and the neighbour (or slave).
//
// - Orientation matters. Internal faces will be split into two faces, and the
//   face that is oriented in the same direction as the zone or surface will be
//   added to the owner/master patch. The other face will be added to the
//   neighbour/slave patch. Boundary faces will be added to the owner patch if
//   they are oriented in the same direction as the zone or surface, and they
//   will be added to the neighbour patch otherwise.
//
// - Optionally, fields can also be modified. If the added patches are of
//   non-constrained type then patch-field entries must be provided for all
//   fields.
//

// Whether to convert internal faces only, and ignore any boundary faces that
// are in the selection
internalFacesOnly true;

// Whether to add patch fields to the field files
fields true;
