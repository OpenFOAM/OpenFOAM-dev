# Description
#     Example of chaining to the standard config.csh/paraview with a
#     different ParaView_VERSION
#
# Note
#     This file could be copied to a user or site location, but should never
#     replace the default shipped version as this will cause an infinite loop
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# Use other (shipped) paraview.csh with a different ParaView_VERSION
