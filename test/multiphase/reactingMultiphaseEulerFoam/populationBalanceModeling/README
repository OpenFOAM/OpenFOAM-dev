The cases contained in this directory can be used for testing the
populationBalanceModel class which is a part of the reactingEulerFoam framework.
They represent single-cell setups, i.e. they solve the population balance
equation without spatial transport. The setups already represent the
inhomogeneous case, i.e. the populationBalance is split over multiple
velocityGroups. This can help to identify wether the populationBalance-induced
mass transfer terms are handled correctly. The cases can also be used to study
the influence of certain parameters on the form of the size distribution, before
running a simulation with spatial transport. Further test cases are contained in
