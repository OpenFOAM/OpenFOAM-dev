The cases contained in this directory can be used for testing the
populationBalanceModel class which is a part of the reactingEulerFoam framework.
They represent single-cell setups, i.e. they solve the population balance
equation without spatial transport. The cases can also be used to study the
influence of certain parameters on the form of the size distribution, before
running a simulation with spatial transport. Further test cases are contained in
