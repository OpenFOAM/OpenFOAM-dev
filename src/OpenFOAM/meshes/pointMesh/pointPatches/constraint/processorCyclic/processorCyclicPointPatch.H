Class
    Foam::processorCyclicPointPatch

Description
    Processor patch boundary needs to be such that the ordering of
    points in the patch is the same on both sides.

    Looking at the creation of the faces on both sides of the processor
    patch they need to be identical on both sides with the normals pointing
    in opposite directions.  This is achieved by calling the reverseFace
    function in the decomposition.  It is therefore possible to re-create
    the ordering of patch points on the slave side by reversing all the
    patch faces of the owner.
