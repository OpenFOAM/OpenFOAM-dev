    polyMeshZipUpCells

Description
    Cell zip-up tool. This function modifies the list of faces such
    that all the cells are topologically closed.  Note that, while
    this operation is perfectly sensible for correct meshes, it may
    lead to arbitrary errors if the mesh is originally broken.
