SRFSimpleFoam has been superseded and replaced by the more general
incompressibleFluid solver module executed by the foamRun application:

    foamRun -solver incompressibleFluid

The MRF functionality has been further developed to replace SRF, enabled by
setting the MRF zone to all the cells in the mesh using the optional
'select' entry to 'all' in the constant/MRFProperties dictionary, e.g.

SRF
{
    select          all;

    origin    (0 0 0);
    axis      (0 0 1);

    rpm       60;
}

Additionally the new 'MRFnoSlip' velocity boundary condition should be applied to the
rotating wall patche in the MRF region.
