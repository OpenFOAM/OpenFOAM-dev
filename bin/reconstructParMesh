#
# Description
#     Script to inform the user that reconstructParMesh has been superseded
#     and replaced by the more general reconstructPar utility.

The reconstructParMesh utility has been superseded and replaced by by the
more general reconstructPar.

The reconstructPar utility now reconstructs the mesh if and when it is
necessary; i.e., when it has changed in the processor* directories as a result
of utility usage or dynamic mesh changes.

Most parallel workflows previously included a call to reconstructParMesh first
to reconstruct the mesh, and then called reconstructPar for the fields. This
sort of workflow can be updated by removing the call to reconstructParMesh.
