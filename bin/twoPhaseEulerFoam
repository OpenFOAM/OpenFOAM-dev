#
# Description
#     Script to inform the user that the twoPhaseEulerFoam solver
#     has been replaced by the more general multiphaseEuler solver module.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cat <<EOF

The twoPhaseEulerFoam solver has been replaced by the more general
multiphaseEuler solver module which supports two-phase and multiphase systems
containing fluid and stationary phases, compressible or incompressible, with
heat and mass transfer, reactions, size distribution and all the usual phase
interaction and transfer models.

When running with two-phases the optional referencePhase entry in
phaseProperties can be used to specify which phase fraction should not be
solved, providing compatibility with reactingtTwoPhaseEulerFoam.
