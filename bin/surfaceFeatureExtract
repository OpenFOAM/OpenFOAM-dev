$Script has been superseded by the "surfaceFeatures" utility.

surfaceFeatures reads a surfaceFeaturesDict input file with a much
simpler, more convenient format.  Example surfaceFeaturesDict files
can be found in the tutorial and template cases, e.g. located as
follows:
find \$FOAM_TUTORIALS -name surfaceFeaturesDict
find \$FOAM_ETC -name surfaceFeaturesDict
