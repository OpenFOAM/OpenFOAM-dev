EnSight User Defined Reader Capability
--------------------------------------

A user defined reader capability is included in EnSight which allows otherwise
unsupported structured or unstructured data to be read.  The user defined
reader utilizes a dynamic shared library composed of routines defined in this
document, but produced by the user (or some third party). This capability is
currently available for dec, ibm, hp, sgi, and sun servers.

****************************************************************************
Note: Several user defined readers have been included with your EnSight
      release and can be accessed by changing the ENSIGHT6_READER
      environment variable as outlined in step 3. below.   Please be aware
      that these are "unsupported" readers, but many of them are being used
      successfully.
****************************************************************************


The process for producing a user defined reader is:
--------------------------------------------------
1. Write code for all pertinent routines in the library (Unless someone else
   has done this for you).

        This is of course where the work is done by the user.  The word
        "pertinent" is used because depending on the nature of the data, some
        of the routines in the library may be dummy routines.

        The source code for a dummy library and for various other working or
        sample libraries is copied from the installation CD during
        installation.  These will be located in directories under:

        $ENSIGHT6_HOME/ensight62/user_defined_src/readers

        examples:
        --------
        The default library. Basic dummy routines.
          $ENSIGHT6_HOME/ensight62/user_defined_src/readers/dummy

        Sample library which reads unstructured binary EnSight6 data.
          $ENSIGHT6_HOME/ensight62/user_defined_src/readers/ensight6

        Sample library which reads binary static plot3d data.
          $ENSIGHT6_HOME/ensight62/user_defined_src/readers/plot3d

        Reads binary LS-DYNA3D state database.
          $ENSIGHT6_HOME/ensight62/user_defined_src/readers/ls-dyna3d

        Reads FORTRAN binary Unstrutured dytran data base.
          $ENSIGHT6_HOME/ensight62/user_defined_src/readers/dytran

        Reads FlowScience "flsgrf" flow3d data.
          $ENSIGHT6_HOME/ensight62/user_defined_src/readers/flow3d

        Reads Tecplot "plt" files.        
          $ENSIGHT6_HOME/ensight62/user_defined_src/readers/tecplot

        Reads Common File Format data.        
          $ENSIGHT6_HOME/ensight62/user_defined_src/readers/cff

        Reads Cobalt grid and picture/restart file data.        
          $ENSIGHT6_HOME/ensight62/user_defined_src/readers/cobalt
 
        You may find it useful to place your library source in this area as
        well, but are not limited to this location.

 * ===>	The descriptions of each library routine and the order that the
	routines are called, which is provided in this file, along with
 	the example libraries, should make it possible for you to produce
	code for your own data reader.	


2. Produce the dynamic shared library.

        This is a compiling and loading process which varies according to
        the type of machine you are on.  Thus, a separate makefile is provided
        for each machine type.  Operating system level differences could cause
        you to have to modify these makefiles slightly, but the general
        process is very straightforward.  Note that for the SGI environment you
        must compile with the following flags to ensure compatability with
        the EnSight server:  Irix_5.3     -mips1
                             Irix_6.2     -mips2
                             Irix_6.5_n32 -mips3
                             Irix_6.5_n64 -mips4 -64

       ------------------------------------------------------------------

   Once you have created your library, you should place it in a directory
   of your choice under:

     $ENSIGHT6_HOME/machines/$ENSIGHT6_ARCH/lib_readers

   Thus, if you created a reader for "mydata", you should create the
   following directory, and place your libuserd.so into it:

     $ENSIGHT6_HOME/machines/$ENSIGHT6_ARCH/lib_readers/mydata


3. Set up the ENSIGHT6_READER environment variable so EnSight will know
   which reader directory to use at runtime.

   Ensight will look for the library under:

     $ENSIGHT6_HOME/machines/$ENSIGHT6_ARCH/lib_readers/$ENSIGHT6_READER

   When EnSight was installed, you set this variable to "dummy", with:

     setenv ENSIGHT6_READER dummy

   You can use any of the other provided readers by changing this variable.
   For example, to use the dytran reader:

     setenv ENSIGHT6_READER dytran 

   Thus, you can use your reader in the same way.  If you provided "mydata",
   change ENSIGHT6_READER to:
 
     setenv ENSIGHT6_READER mydata


   For your information, EnSight makes sure that the appropriate library
   environment variable is set for your machine architecture. You do not
   have to deal with this if you locate your library as outlined above.
   The library environment variables used are:

        Machine type    Environment variable to set
        ------------    ---------------------------
        sgi             LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        dec             LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        sun             LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        hp              SHLIB_PATH
        ibm             LIBPATH

IMPORTANT:  Unless the shared library is available in the
            .../$ENSIGHT6_READER directory, EnSight will not run.

As always, EnSight support is available if you need it.

Basis of arrays:
---------------
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all arrays are zero based - in true C
fashion.


Global variables:
----------------
You will generally need to have a few global variables which are shared by
the various library routines. The detailed specifications below have assumed
the following are available.  (Their names describe their purpose, and they
will be used in helping describe the details of the routines below).

static int Numparts_available      = 0;
static int Num_unstructured_parts  = 0;
static int Num_structured_blocks   = 0;

/* Note: Numparts_available = Num_unstructured_parts + Num_structured_blocks */

USERD_bkup

   Description:
   -----------
   This routine is called during the EnSight archive process.  You can
   use it to save or restore info relating to your user defined reader.

   Specification:
   -------------
   int USERD_bkup(FILE *archive_file,
                  int backup_type)

   Returns:
   -------
   Z_OK  if successful
   Z_ERR if not successful

   Arguments:
   ---------
   (IN)  archive_file         = The archive file pointer

   (IN)  backup_type          = Z_SAVE_ARCHIVE for saving archive
                                Z_REST_ARCHIVE for restoring archive

   Notes:
   -----
   * Since EnSight's archive file is saved in binary form, you should
     also do any writing to it or reading from it in binary.

   * You should archive any variables, which will be needed for
     future operations, that will not be read or computed again
     before they will be needed.  These are typically global
     variables.

   * Make sure that the number of bytes that you write on a save and
     the number of bytes that you read on a restore are identical!!

   * If any of the variables you save are allocated arrays, you must
     do the allocations before restoring into them.

           coord_array[1] will be accessed by node 2 from the conn_array, etc.

      ex) Given a model of two triangles, you should load coord_array in

   Description:
   -----------
   Answers the question as to whether element labels will be provided.

   Specification:

   int USERD_get_element_label_status( void )

   Returns:
   -------
   TRUE        if element labels will be provided
   FALSE       if element labels will NOT be provided

   Arguments:
   ---------
   none

   Notes:
   -----
   * element lables are needed in order to do any element querying, or
     element labeling on-screen within EnSight.

       For unstructured parts, you can read them from your file if
       available, or can assign them, etc. They need to be unique
       per part, and are often unique per model.

         USERD_get_element_ids_for_part is used to obtain the ids,
         on a part by part basis, if TRUE status is returned here.

       For structured parts, EnSight will assign ids if you return a
         status of TRUE here.  You cannot assign them youself!!

USERD_get_node_label_status

   Description:
   -----------
   Answers the question as to whether node labels will be provided.

   Specification:
   -------------
   int USERD_get_node_label_status( void )

   Returns:
   -------
   TRUE        if node labels will be provided
   FALSE       if node labels will NOT be provided

   Arguments:
   ---------
   none

   Notes:
   -----
   * Node ids are needed in order to do any node querying, or node
     labeling on-screen within EnSight.

       For unstructured parts, you can read them from your file if
       available, or can assign them, etc. They need to be unique
       per part, and are often unique per model.  The must also be
       positive numbers greater than zero.

         USERD_get_global_node_ids is used to obtain the ids, if the
         status returned here is TRUE.

         Also be aware that if you say node labels are available,
         the connectivity of elements must be according to these
         node ids.

       For structured parts, EnSight will assign ids if you return a
         status of TRUE here.  You cannot assign them yourself!!



--------------------------------------------------------------------
USERD_get_number_of_files_in_dataset

   Description:
   -----------
   Get the total number of files in the dataset.  Used for the
   dataset query option within EnSight.

   Specification:
   -------------
   int USERD_get_number_of_files_in_dataset( void )

   Returns:
   -------
   The total number of files in the dataset.

   Arguments:
   ---------
   none

   Notes:
   -----
   * You can be as complete as you want about this.  If you don't
     care about the dataset query option, return a value of 0
     If you only want certain files, you can just include them. But,
     you will need to supply the info in USERD_get_dataset_query_file_info
     for each file you include here.

   * Num_dataset_files would be set here



--------------------------------------------------------------------
USERD_get_number_of_global_nodes

   Description:
   -----------
   Gets the number of global nodes, used for unstructured parts.

   Specification:
   -------------
   int USERD_get_number_of_global_nodes()

   Returns:
   -------
   Number of global nodes (>=0 if okay, <0 if problems)

   Arguments:
   ---------
   none

   Notes:
   -----
   * Not called unless Num_unstructured_parts is > 0

   * Will be based on Current_time_step

   * For unstructured data:
           EnSight wants  1. A global array of nodes
                          2. Element connectivities by part, which
                             reference the node numbers of the global
                             node array.
                IMPORTANT:
                ---------
                If you provide node ids, then element connectivities
                must be in terms of the node ids.  If you do not
                provide node ids, then element connectivities must be
                in terms of the index into the node array, but shifted
                to start at 1

   * Num_global_nodes would be set here



--------------------------------------------------------------------
USERD_get_number_of_model_parts

   Description:
   -----------
   Gets the total number of unstructured and structured parts
   in the model, for which you can supply information.

   Specification:
   -------------
   int USERD_get_number_of_model_parts( void )

   Returns:
   -------
   Number of parts  (>0 if okay, <=0 if probs).

   Arguments:
   ---------
   none

   Notes:
   -----
   * If going to have to read down through the parts in order to
     know how many, you may want to build a table of pointers to
     the various parts, so you can easily get to particular parts in
     later processes.  If you can simply read the number of parts
     at the head of the file, then you would probably not build the
     table at this time.

   * This routine would set Numparts_available, which is equal to
     Num_unstructured_parts + Num_structured_blocks.



--------------------------------------------------------------------
USERD_get_number_of_time_steps

   Description:
   -----------
   Gets the number of time steps of data available.

   Specification:
   -------------
   int USERD_get_number_of_time_steps( void )

   Returns:
   -------
   Number of time steps  (>0 if okay, <=0 if problems).

   Arguments:
   ---------
   none

   Notes:
   -----
   * This should be >= 1       1 indicates a static model
                              >1 indicates a transient model

   * Num_time_steps would be set here

   Returns:
   -------
   Number of variables (includes constant, scalar, and vector types)
                       (>=0 if okay, <0 if problem)

   Arguments:
   ---------
   none

   * The per_node or per_elem classification must be obtainable from the

USERD_set_filenames

   Description:
   -----------
   Receives the geometry and result filenames entered in the data
   dialog.  The user written code will have to store and use these
   as needed.

   Specification:
   -------------
   int USERD_set_filenames(char filename_1[],
                           char filename_2[],

   Z_ERR if not successful

   Arguments:
   ---------
   (IN) filename_1   = the filename entered into the geometry
                         field of the data dialog.
   (IN) filename_2   = the filename entered into the result
                         field of the data dialog.
			 (If the two_fields flag in USERD_get_name_of_reader
			  is FALSE, this will be null string)
   (IN) the_path     = the path info from the data dialog.
                       Note: filename_1 and filename_2 have already
                            had the path prepended to them.  This
                            is provided in case it is needed for
                            filenames contained in one of the files
   (IN) swapbytes    = TRUE if should swap bytes when reading data.

   Notes:
   -----
   * Since you must manage everything from the input that is entered in
     these data dialog fields, this is an important routine!

   * It may be that you will need to have an executive type file that contains
     info and other filenames within it, like EnSight6's case file.



--------------------------------------------------------------------
USERD_set_time_step

   Description:
   -----------
   Set the current time step.  All functions that need time, and
   that do not explicitly pass it in, will use the time step set by
   this routine.

   Specification:
   -------------
   void USERD_set_time_step(int time_step)

   Returns:
   -------
   nothing

   Arguments:
   ---------
   (IN) time_step - The current time step to set

   Notes:
   -----
   * Current_time_step would be set here



--------------------------------------------------------------------
USERD_stop_part_building

   Description:
   -----------
   This routine called when the part building dialog is closed.  It is
   provided in case you desire to release memory, etc. that was only needed
   during the part building process.

   Specification:
   -------------
   void USERD_stop_part_building( void )

   Returns:
   -------
   nothing

   Arguments:
   ---------
   none
